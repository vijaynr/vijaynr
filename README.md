I'm a Software engineer curious about solving problems (and sometimes creating problems) - who is currently exploring and learning to work with various technologies across the stack like Angular, Java, Spring, PostgreSQL etc. I've also dabbled in desktop application development for a while using Python, Objective C/C++ and C#. Besides work, you can see my doodling and scribbling in my notebook or tablet.

I do try to blog occasionally. You can read it [here](https://vijaynr.github.io).
