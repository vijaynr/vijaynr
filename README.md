## Hi, I’m Vijay 👋
![cover](https://github.com/vijaynr/vijaynr/blob/9b9bfccd1844590efd22dae471239ac9eef4070c/cover.png)

I'm an **Engineer** and a Individual contributor curious about software and related technologies. Currently, I'm exploring various technologies across stack ranging from Angular, Java, Spring, PostgreSQL etc. I've also dabbled in developing client applications on macOS and Windows for a while using Python, Objective C/C++ and C#. Besides work, you can see my doodling and scribbling in my notebook or ipad.
