## Hi, I’m Vijay 👋
![cover](https://github.com/vijaynr/vijaynr/blob/8518923028e511c9f19b2f3274b31cdcce963937/cover.png)

I'm a Software engineer, curious about solving problems (and sometimes creating problems). Currently, I'm exploring various technologies across the stack ranging from Angular, Java, Spring, PostgreSQL etc. I've also dabbled in application development on macOS and Windows for a while using Python, Objective C/C++ and C#. Besides work, you can see my doodling and scribbling in my notebook or tablet.

I try to blog occasionally. Read it [here](https://vijaynr.github.io).
